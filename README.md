# Summary

A web based application built on the React framework of Javascript. I used the PokeAPI API to extract information about Pokemon and then displayed their information in an interactive card format. Clicking on a card directs you to a personalized profile for each Pokemon. Each profile contains a picture of the Pokemon sprite, progress bars for their turn-based combat abilities, color-coded type badges, height, weight, gender-ratio, evs, etc. All features were displayed with the usage of Twitter's Bootstrap suite.
